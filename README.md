# Trickdown

Trickdown is a trick app to use for your friends. It is very easy to use just click on button then button will disappear **(It means you can't get back)**.
And then countdown will start with music and all the screen colors will change(not background).

# Git Clone

As you can see I don't have "node_modules" folder. It is heavy to upload. After git clone you need to run "npm i" before "npm start". It will download all the packages.
